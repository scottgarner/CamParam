# CamParam

I was shocked to find no simple way to change basic webcam settings (gain, exposure, etc.) from the command line on Windows. After much time spent looking at existing approaches, I finally gave in and wrote this little program.

An earlier C# version of this program is [CamParamSharp](https://github.com/scottgarner/CamParamSharp).

## Usage

```
// List available devices.

CamParam.exe              

// Output

0 HD Pro Webcam C920     
1 OBS Virtual Camera
```

```
// List properties for a device.

CamParam.exe device 0

// Output

Pan 0
Tilt 0
Roll 0
Zoom 100
Exposure -5
Iris -5
Focus 15
Brightness 128
Contrast 128
Hue 128
Saturation 128
Sharpness 128
Gamma 128
ColorEnable 128
WhiteBalance 4200
BacklightCompensation 0
Gain 64
```

```
// Set exposure and gain for device "0".

CamParam.exe device 0 gain 64 exposure -5  

// Output

Exposure -5
Gain 64
```

The basis of this program is heavily influenced by [CommandCam](https://github.com/tedburke/CommandCam/blob/master/Makefile).
